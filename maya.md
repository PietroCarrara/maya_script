// This code was written by the Mayans, long before the Europeans arrived. It shows a benchmark on how the respondent did compared to others. Nobody knows how it works but
// the Mayans have been using this code for over centuries as have their fathers before them. many sacrifices to Xmucane and Xpiayoc, the gods that created the
// first humans, have been made in order to keep it working.

// If you want to change anything in this code, sacrifice two virgins, but only during full moon. Or make sure you can test this.
